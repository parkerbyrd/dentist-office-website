			<div class="about-dentist">
				<p>Located at 102 S. Venture Drive, in the heart of downtown Greenville, across the street from One City Plaza, Crockett Pediatric Dentistry, a Cosmetic and Family Dental Practice, provides extended hours to allow you to schedule your dental appointments around your work or school schedule. As an added convenience, the office accepts most dental insurances and files the claims for you.</p><br>

				<p>Dr. Mary Crockett and her dedicated team have brought the latest technology to downtown Greenville to enhance their ability to diagnose issues early, and provide the most effective treatment possible. With these capabilities we are able to provide you with a stress free dental visit.</p><br>

				<p>The relaxing atmosphere of the waiting room is a great place to sit and read, but the team works hard to ensure that you do not spend very much of your precious time waiting. From the office entrance to the ergonomic chairs in the treatment rooms, our office provides you with a spa like feel. We hope you even enjoy a complimentary paraffin hand wax treatment during your cleaning appointment. The only thing better than the relaxing experience is the high quality of dental care you will receive.</p><br>

				<p>Now, pick up the phone and contact Crockett Pediatric Dentistry for your first step to great dental health!</p>
