				<p>"Dr. Crockett has a passion for what she does and if you, as a parent, are a soft, sissy, emotional, type of person she isn't the dentist for you.  She will tell you like it is.  As a family, that is what WE are looking for.  So, the fit works for us.  My 4 year old daughter FEARED the dentist before going to Dr. Crockett and now she looks forward to going, because in her words, they give AWESOME prizes.  Our 8 year old just loves it because he could spend all day in the lobby as they have video games, a play house, train set, and TV's everywhere. The staff is amazing and always helpful.  They remember your name and you're not just another patient number."</p>

				<p>"Dr. Crockett is an amazing, caring person, and I choose to bring my children to her office instead of one closer to our home in Spartanburg. She shows great concern for my children and their dental health, and she seems to have an honest interest in their overall well-being. The rest of her staff are also very caring, patient and kind to my children. I would highly recommend her!"</p>

				<p>"Dr Crockett has been wonderful to me and my son. He had to have extensive work done and is NOT SCARED of the dentist after being worked on by her twice. That speaks for itself."</p>
